# TicTacToe

A small Python console-based TicTacToe application which supports a single player against a computer.  It is based on the demo project by Kylie Ying on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=1274s).  This version has been slightly refactored to remove hardcoded values.

Enhancements include a GUI, allowing the player to select their letter, allowing player vs player and AI vs AI.
